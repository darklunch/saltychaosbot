# SaltyChaosBot üßÇüåÄ

Welcome to **SaltyChaosBot**‚Äîan automated betting bot for [SaltyBet](https://www.saltybet.com/) that marries cryptographically secure randomness with a touch of absurdist chaos and ever-shifting digital art. Born from the creative minds at Dark Lunch Studios and crafted by unsoundlogic, this script doesn't just bet‚Äîit performs a kinetic, colorful dance of chance and artistry.

Pro-tip: Although anecdotal I find you have the best luck when the dot in the top right corner is green. If it's red or blue you are going to have a bad time.

## Art & Absurdity

SaltyChaosBot is more than just a bot‚Äîit‚Äôs an interactive piece of digital performance art. Here‚Äôs what sets it apart:

- **Gradient Animations:**  
  The UI employs continuously shifting gradients, powered by CSS custom properties and keyframe animations, turning every bet into a visual spectacle.

- **Chaotic Mathematics:**  
  The coin flip mechanism harnesses a riot of mathematical constants (Golden Ratio, Pi, Euler‚Äôs number, etc.) and even quantum randomness to produce a decision-making process that is as unpredictable as it is artful.

- **Dynamic Interactions:**  
  Every chaos click and every bet placed adjusts the aesthetics of the UI, blending function with form in a mesmerizing dance of color and randomness.
